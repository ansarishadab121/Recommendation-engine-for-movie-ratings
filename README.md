In today’s world, every customer is faced with multiple choices. For example, If I’m looking for a book to read without any specific idea of what I want, there’s a wide range of possibilities how my search might pan out. I might waste a lot of time browsing around on the internet and trawling through various sites hoping to strike gold. I might look for recommendations from other people.

But if there was a site or app which could recommend me books based on what I have read previously, that would be a massive help. Instead of wasting time on various sites, I could just log in and voila! 10 recommended books tailored to my taste.
This is what recommendation engines do and their power is being harnessed by most businesses these days. From Amazon to Netflix, Google to Goodreads, recommendation engines are one of the most widely used applications of machine learning techniques.
1. What are recommendation engines?
Till recently, people generally tended to buy products recommended to them by their friends or the people they trust. This used to be the primary method of purchase when there was any doubt about the product. But with the advent of the digital age, that circle has expanded to include online sites that utilize some sort of recommendation engine.

A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy.

If a completely new user visits an e-commerce site, that site will not have any past history of that user. So how does the site go about recommending products to the user in such a scenario? One possible solution could be to recommend the best selling products, i.e. the products which are high in demand. Another possible solution could be to recommend the products which would bring the maximum profit to the business.

If we can recommend a few items to a customer based on their needs and interests, it will create a positive impact on the user experience and lead to frequent visits. Hence, businesses nowadays are building smart and intelligent recommendation engines by studying the past behavior of their users.

Now that we have an intuition of recommendation engines, let’s now look at how they work.

 

2. How does a recommendation engine work?
Before we deep dive into this topic, first we’ll think of how we can recommend items to users:

We can recommend items to a user which are most popular among all the users
We can divide the users into multiple segments based on their preferences (user features) and recommend items to them based on the segment they belong to
Both of the above methods have their drawbacks. In the first case, the most popular items would be the same for each user so everybody will see the same recommendations. While in the second case, as the number of users increases, the number of features will also increase. So classifying the users into various segments will be a very difficult task.

The main problem here is that we are unable to tailor recommendations based on the specific interest of the users. It’s like Amazon is recommending you buy a laptop just because it’s been bought by the majority of the shoppers. But thankfully, Amazon (or any other big firm) does not recommend products using the above mentioned approach. They use some personalized methods which help them in recommending products more accurately.

Movielens data is collected and item item and user user collabrabtive filtering as well as matrix factorization is used to predict rating and developpe a recommendation model.
